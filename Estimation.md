# Project Estimation  
Date: 09/04/2022

Version: 0.1


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |           10                  |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |             100               | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |   100 ph                                   |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 3000â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |       3-4 days           |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 100 | 3-4 working days|
| estimate by product decomposition | 165 | 5-6 working days| 
| estimate by activity decomposition | 165| 5-6 working days|
